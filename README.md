# Board Game Hub

A web-based, real-time multiplayer board game platform. This hub allows friends to jump in and play classic and modern board games directly in their browser.

The core of the experience is peer-to-peer connectivity using **WebRTC**, which ensures low-latency gameplay. Firebase is used only as a signaling server to help players find and connect to each other. Once the connection is established, all game data is sent directly between the players' browsers.
